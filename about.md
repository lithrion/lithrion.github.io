Leigh has an interest in Cryptography and has done some research on the topic using [*An introduction to Mathematical Cryptography* by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman](https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Cryptogr/z2SBIhmqMBMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), which included the Mathematics behind RSA asymmetric cryptography. Leigh has a B.S. in Mathematics from UCLA and a M.A. in Mathematics with a teaching focus from CSU Fullerton.

Previously Leigh was a Mathematics teacher and taught AP Calculus at Westview High School with 100% of his students passing the AP Exam. His interests include nearly all things gaming, and his most recent hobby is 3D printing and painting miniatures.
