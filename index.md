Welcome to my portfolio where I've posted a handful of Cybersecurity related projects that I have done. I have included projects from the Cybersecurity Bootcamp that I took through UCSD as well as a walkthrough of a Hack the Box machine that I gained root access on.

I have bash script that I will be posting here soon that I wrote to automate the process of turning a csv file of product specs into product pages for an ecommerce website.

### Current Projects
- GitHub Pages

  This portfolio is one of my current projects. In addition to adding content, I'm learning Jekyll and importing custom theme elements into GitHub.
  
- Ruby on Rails

  There is a task I am working on automating that will printing barcodes based on webhook triggers. The planned solution involves creating a web app that can receive a webhook and pass the data along to a barcode handling application. The tutorials for the web platform and command line tools for generating boilerplate code appear to be based off of outdated versions of the web server's API and no longer function. I am currently looking into learning more about Ruby on Rails in order to build the basic web app.
